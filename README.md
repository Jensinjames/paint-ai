## What is Paint AI?

Paint AI is a fun project exploring how AI can be used to develop software.

Thousands of software developers are using AI chat and code-completion tools to
help them write code.

In a world-first, Paint AI takes this one step further, getting AI to write, test
and deploy code without any human involvement!

## How to use Paint AI

Paint AI is the world's first paint program with no pens, paintbrushes or
anything to paint with. It is completely useless until you ask the AI to create
some painting tools, just for you.  Click "New Tool" and describe what you would
like. The AI will attempt to write some software for you that will give you what
you need. Another AI will test the code and deploy it live.

Once you have created some tools, you can also ask the AI to edit, change or
improve the tool and it will attempt to edit the code and deploy another version
of your tool.

Most tools and edits take the AI less than a minute to code.

## What is this for?

This project is a just a proof of concept. An experiment in AI coding. The
source code making up this project provides an example structure for integrating
AI-written code into a software application.

For simplicity and safety, only client-side JavaScript is created by the AI and
an attempt is made to ensure the code meets certain criteria. But, like human
coders, the AI will make mistakes and some of the code created will simply not
work.
